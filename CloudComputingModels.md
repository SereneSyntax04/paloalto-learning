# Cloud Computing Models

## What is Cloud Computing?
- Cloud computing is not about a physical place. Instead, it is a collection of computing resources (like servers, storage, and applications) that you can quickly use whenever needed. 
- These resources are provided on-demand and are managed automatically(by cloud service provider).

## Benefits of Cloud Computing
1. Resource Pooling & Cost Savings
- Resources (like servers, storage, etc.) are shared.
- This lowers costs â†’ economies of scale.
- Works for both private and public clouds.

2. Agility & Flexibility
- No need for many separate, under-used servers.
- Resources are combined, shared, and flexible.
- Scale up or down quickly based on your organizationâ€™s needs.

## ðŸŒŸ Other Benefits of Cloud / Virtual Systems
1. Segmented Administration : Separate control for each org.
2. Scalability : Easy to add or remove customers/units
3. Reduced Expenses : Saves money on hardware, electricity, rack space, and maintenance.
4. Sharing Mappings : Shared mappings = simpler management.
