<h1 align="center">Cortex Cloud: CSPM & Governance ☁️🛡️</h1>

## 🌐 Cloud Security Posture Management (CSPM)
Cortex Cloud goes beyond basic compliance/config checks.  
- Uses **30+ data sources** for vulnerability intelligence → instant clarity on critical issues.  
- Prevents insecure configs early in the **development pipeline** (before production).  


## 🔎 Visibility, Compliance & Governance

### 1. **Cloud Asset Inventory**
- Full visibility & control over deployed resources.  
- Not just aggregation → analyzes & normalizes data for **risk clarity**.  

### 2. **Compliance Monitoring & Reporting**
- Continuous monitoring of cloud compliance.  
- **One-click reports** from a single console.  
- Built-in compliance frameworks + option to create custom ones.  

### 3. **Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) Scanning**
- Scans IaC templates for vulnerabilities.  
- Build **cloud-agnostic policies** across build & runtime phases.

<h1 align="center">Data Security 🔒📊</h1>

Cortex Cloud’s **Data Security** helps discover, classify & protect sensitive data stored in objects,  
preventing **exposure, misuse, or sharing**.


## 🔑 Key Capabilities

### 1. **Data Visibility & Classification**
- Full visibility into objects → by **region, owner, exposure level**.  
- Fine-tune identifiers → detect SSNs, credit card numbers, driver’s licenses, etc.  

### 2. **Data Governance**
- Enforce policies to determine **risk profile** by classification & exposure.  
- Enable compliance profiles → **PCI DSS, GDPR, SOC 2, HIPAA**.  
- Generate **audit-ready reports** with one click.  

### 3. **Malware Detection**
- Detects **known & unknown threats** in files.  
- Uses **WildFire service** to flag infected objects.  

### 4. **Alerting & Remediation**
- Auto-alerts for risky objects (by exposure & file type).  
- Analysts can remediate → fix exposure, tag DevOps teams, or delete malware.  


## 📊 Data Dashboard
Cortex Cloud provides a **Data Dashboard tab** under the main console:  
- Shows number of **buckets & objects**.  
- Breaks down **data type, region, ownership & exposure**.
